  abstract = {Fuzzing network servers is a technical challenge, since the behavior of the target server depends on its state over a sequence of multiple messages. Existing solutions are costly and difficult to use, as they rely on manually-customized artifacts such as protocol models, protocol parsers, and learning frameworks. The aim of this work is to develop a greybox fuzzer (StateAFL) for network servers that only relies on lightweight analysis of the target program, with no manual customization, in a similar way to what the AFL fuzzer achieved for stateless programs. The proposed fuzzer instruments the target server at compile-time, to insert probes on memory allocations and network I/O operations. At run-time, it infers the current protocol state of the target server by taking snapshots of long-lived memory areas, and by applying a fuzzy hashing algorithm (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) to map memory contents to a unique state identifier. The fuzzer incrementally builds a protocol state machine for guiding fuzzing. We implemented and released StateAFL as open-source software. As a basis for reproducible experimentation, we integrated StateAFL with a large set of network servers for popular protocols, with no manual customization to accomodate for the protocol. The experimental results show that the fuzzer can be applied with no manual customization on a large set of network servers for popular protocols, and that it can achieve comparable, or even better code coverage and bug detection than customized fuzzing. Moreover, our qualitative analysis shows that states inferred from memory better reflect the server behavior than only using response codes from messages.},

  abstract  = {Grey-box fuzzing is an evolutionary process, which maintains and evolves a population of test cases with the help of a fitness function. Fitness functions used by current grey-box fuzzers are not informative in that they cannot distinguish different program executions as long as those executions achieve the same coverage. The problem is that current fitness functions only consider a union of data, but not their combination. As such, fuzzers often get stuck in a local optimum during their search. In this paper, we introduce Ankou, the first grey-box fuzzer that recognizes different combinations of execution information, and present several scalability challenges encountered while designing and implementing Ankou. Our experimental results show that Ankou is 1.94\texttimes{} and 8.0\texttimes{} more effective in finding bugs than AFL and Angora, respectively.},

  abstract   = {Coverage-guided fuzz testing has gained prominence as a highly effective method of finding security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows in programs that parse binary data. Recently, researchers have introduced various specializations to the coverage-guided fuzzing algorithm for different domain-specific testing goals, such as finding performance bottlenecks, generating valid inputs, handling magic-byte comparisons, etc. Each such solution can require non-trivial implementation effort and produces a distinct variant of a fuzzing tool. We observe that many of these domain-specific solutions follow a common solution pattern.  In this paper, we present FuzzFactory, a framework for developing domain-specific fuzzing applications without requiring changes to mutation and search heuristics. FuzzFactory allows users to specify the collection of dynamic domain-specific feedback during test execution, as well as how such feedback should be aggregated. FuzzFactory uses this information to selectively save intermediate inputs, called waypoints, to augment coverage-guided fuzzing. Such waypoints always make progress towards domain-specific multi-dimensional objectives. We instantiate six domain-specific fuzzing applications using FuzzFactory: three re-implementations of prior work and three novel solutions, and evaluate their effectiveness on benchmarks from Google's fuzzer test suite. We also show how multiple domains can be composed to perform better than the sum of their parts. For example, we combine domain-specific feedback about strict equality comparisons and dynamic memory allocations, to enable the automatic generation of LZ4 bombs and PNG bombs.},
